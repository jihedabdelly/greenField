Please make sure you read this carefully as we move forward into the project.

## Getting started
Please make sure you interact with this repo as we usually do with the toyproblems. You will see that each one of us has his own branch.

* Fork the master Repo to your Github account
* Clone it to your machine
* Create remote called _project_ in case there are things that you need to pull, this is done by 'git remote add project https://github.com/GeekGhosts/greenfield-project'

## Throughout the development process
* Check status, commit and push with meaningful comments to your own repo
* Create a pull request to **YOUR OWN BRANCH**, not to the

## Let's put that in practice
In your respective local branches, update your README by pulling from the master remote, pushing to your branch and making a pull request!
